    <h2>About The EVI Project</h2>
    <p>
        This project aims to give teachers the resources needed in order to deliver high quality Explicit Vocabulary Instruction (EVI) of critical words. <br><br>

        <strong><i>There are many great ways to teach vocabulary, so what type of vocabulary instruction are you referring to?</i></strong> <br><br>
        
        Explicit Vocabulary Instruction is a teaching method that emphasises structured and systematic instruction in critical vocabulary. It aims to maximise student engagement and success by ensuring that students develop a deep understanding of word meanings. This is achieved through direct teaching methods that combine key features of oral and written language, frequent checks for understanding, and systematic scaffolding to reduce reliance on guesswork.
      <br><br>
      <strong><i>What's included in the resource?</i></strong> <br><br>
      In the folder, you’ll find a Google Slide file for each word. Each file includes 3 teaching slides and 16 'Check for Understanding' (CFU) retrieval slides. The CFU slides are arranged from easy to hard, allowing you to leverage meaningful and effortful spaced retrieval of the word in various contexts. All slides include a DI script that can be followed to maximize efficiency and impact. <br><br>
      
      <strong><i><b></b> A little caveat...</b></i></strong> <br><br>
      These slides were created with the assistance of 'Chatty' (ChatGPT) along with some other coding. There may be minor errors, and the images may not always match perfectly, as I'm using a free website API that fetches the most relevant visuals. Please skim through each slide before teaching and adapt it to suit your needs.
   <br><br>
    <strong><i><b></b> In hope for the utopian website</b></i></strong> <br><br>
      I’m still working on bringing teachers a tool that will allow them to create these resources themselves for any word they choose. Watch this space.
